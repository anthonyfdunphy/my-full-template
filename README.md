MUSIC VENUE - README

This project is a website based on a Dublin music venue page - where there is a Homepage, an About page and a Contact page. Users will be able to load up the page, navitage to the different section in the header. When they are on a page - the menu bar will stay rounded on the corners with a shadow box around the tab which gradually faded in and out to the different shape/size ta when switching between active and unactive. Images have been added to accompany the different sections. Hover and animation style were experiemented with during the creation of this website.

Used W3C Validator to clean up code as best as possible. I found erros with stray </i> tags which were not needed at all.
